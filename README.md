# DV8 (Deviate)

This is a set of simple scripts that uses the public real time tracking API
for the BJCTA Max Bus System at:

https://realtimebjcta.availtec.com/InfoPoint/swagger/docs/v1

This pulls down the information on all the buses every few seconds and
records it in a database, so that later on, we can run reports.
